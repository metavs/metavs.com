{"description":"The Vault Pass acts like a membership pass within our Metaverse. Vault Passes generate staking rewards which can be used to buy NFTs from the METAVS Vault, whitelist access to future drops, and more. A % of all future METAVS drops will be sent to the Vault. The Vault will launch with 750 Metapasses on mint.
